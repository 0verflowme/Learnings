I felt so much bored checking Jenkins Low Hanging Fruits. So wrote this 

```
MrR3boot~/Downloads$ python pwnjenkins.py 

Usage : python pwnjenkins.py domains.txt (For diff ports ex: abc.xyz:8080)

Current Checks:
	1. Auth/Unauthenticated Groovy Console (Provided Creds/Registration)
	2. CVE-2019-10030{29,30}[Only uses exception to get secrets]
  ```
